# Interval Scheduling
## Purpose
<!--Purpose-->
This is an interval scheduling program, designed to find non-overlapping intervals from a given text file that contains intervals with start and end times.

## Description
When launched, the user is prompted to provide the name of the text file which contains the time intervals list. Then, the
program prints the current number of intervals, and the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals. However, if the
text file provided by the user does not exist, the user will be notified and asked whether they wish to create another schedule.
The program will keep on running for as long as the user wants to create schedules.
